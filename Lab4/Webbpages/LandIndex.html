            <article>
                Nearly every inhabitant knows more than one profession. A fisherman may not only know fishing, but also carpentry or masonry works. Fishing is the dominant occupation of this close-knit community, and the island is famed for its yellowfin tuna. The people of this island are famous for their braveness and strong adherence with each other. Most of the people are involved with different games. Football, volleyball, tennis, badminton and swimming are the common sport items in the island. The life of the island society is casual, peaceful, spiritual and family-oriented. Football, volleyball, tennis, badminton and swimming are common sports; there is even a football field.

                Almost all are Sunni Muslims; local language is Dhivehi, however most people know and speak English language well. The people of the island are family oriented. As the Maldives is in the middle of Indian Ocean, the route has long been a meeting place for African, Arab, Malay and Indonesian mariners. This exchange has led to a very diverse culture; composed of many different ethnic groups. There are descendants of Tamil, Sinhalese, and Indians; all who live harmoniously yet are proud of their origins. The people of the Ukulhas have distinct physical features – “white smiles”, honey-colored eyes and brownish hair.

            <article>
                The island has had a series of political changes throughout the last couple of decades. Before the existence and the ratification of present constitution, the island had been entirely centralized by the central government. The island had a chief (Head of the Island) who had to be appointed by the Atoll chief (Head of Atoll). The atoll chief was a person who had to be appointed by the Minister of Atolls and Administration. Because of an autocratic rule which had been kept over the people by the government, the island chief had no power to make his own decision for his concern matters; he had to send messages to the Atoll office where the Atoll Chief had to get prior permission by Minister of Atolls and Administration before sending back the reply to the island office. So the minister had the fully power to control over the island and its people. Because of the appointees to the chief posts of the island and atoll, chiefs or heads were fully controlled by the Minister. As a result of those appointees, island people had no power to elect the people by themselves. Eventually disputes started to arise between chiefs and the people of the island. Island people did not have the right to decide what they wanted; beside that they had to accept whatever orders were given by the island chief, either good or bad.

            <article>
                Ukulhas culture has been diversified by Arabs, Africans, Sinhalese, and Indians. Lifestyle and the ordinary dress of the man was very simple, consisting of drawers, a cloth bound around the loins, after the mode of the Singhalese, and a handkerchief twisted round the head. On special days, such as Fridays, when they attend the mosque, the high caste wears a shirt and jacket.

                The women's costume is exceedingly becoming. A cloth is worn around the waist, and reaching down to the ankles, (mostly of native manufacture), coarse in texture, of a dark chocolate colour, with a border of parallel black and white stripes. Over this they wear a kind of loose shirt, or gown, of silk, with short sleeves, reaching nearly to the knees, which is not made to fit to the neck and shoulders, but is gathered in round them; the openings for the neck and arms are ornamented with embroidery in gold, silver, and silk thread. The hair, which is black, and generally long and thick, is tied up behind, and a handkerchief of the same colour as the shirt is bound round it. All ranks wear similar costumes, the distinctions of caste being marked by the difference in the quality of the silk material of which the shirt is made, and of the embroidery.

                Maldivians were denoted for a great skill of manufacturing mats as though they were fond of great skill of lacquer and fine arts, which led them to hold their reputation upon their harmonious life and furnishing of their reputation. In Suvadiva Atoll of Maldives they were made from a grass called by the Maldivian hau; which were used with three colours of black, dark yellow and white and which were obtained from plants which were lasted quite a long time. Walls mostly were built from coconut thatch, which surrounded most of the houses at the height of six to seven feet. This impeded the free air passage especially as the windows where too small to admit the breezes, which results in some residents being unhealthy even though their houses were scrupulously clean. The Maldivian so-called design, wass sometimes made apparent in case of illness, as many could have survived if they could have refrained from closing the passage of air. The inner compartment in the houses was used as a sleeping room in many of the houses, and this apartment also remains for women especially when they were not engaged in household or any other activity.
